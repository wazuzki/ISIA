In this subject, I expect to learn how different parts of a systemâ€”like software, hardware, databases, and networks. I also expect to explore how systems are integrated, or how separate applications and platforms can be linked so that they share data and function as one. This subject will not only teach the concepts but also prepare me for modern technologies like cloud computing.

Given that practically all businesses today rely on integrated systems to conduct their operations, it also helps us get ready for issues that may arise in the real world. System architecture and integration education increases our ability to adapt, sharpens our problem-solving abilities, and provides us with useful information for future employment in business technology, engineering, or information technology.

I hope this subject will greatly impact us by enhancing our skills and helping us develop the adaptability we need to continue growing. It will also give us a solid basis on which to build our future jobs and real-world experiences.
